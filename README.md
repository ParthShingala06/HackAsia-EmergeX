As the world is engulfed with COVID-19 pandemic and the glimpse of vaccine is still a distant dream, taking precautions and maintaining the norms suggested by WHO will keep us safe. With this, we present in this paper a solution that would help travelers induce confidence in traveling while keeping in mind the guidelines that must be followed. The solution focuses on an end to end service that will not only help the travelers to make informed and safe decisions but also allow the hospitality industry to monetize from this application. This paper is focused on a detailed analysis of the solution that is being presented to tackle the problems faced by various industries and their fear of resuming the work. A software based approach is taken for providing a simple and engaging user experience to the user along with an AI approach to detect and predict the COVID trend in various cities. Along with this, a system that detects if people are wearing a mask or not will also be verified by the algorithm.
